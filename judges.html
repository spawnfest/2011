  <p>
Ulf Wiger became one of the first commercial users of Erlang (certainly the first in North America) when he bought a license in 1993. At the time, he was busy designing disaster response systems in Alaska. In 1996, he joined Ericsson and became Chief Designer of the AXD 301 development. At nearly 2 million lines of Erlang code, AXD 301 is the most complex system ever built in Erlang, and probably the most complex commercial system built in any functional language. In recent years, Ulf has been involved in several products based on the AXD 301 architecture, and has been an active member of the Open Source Erlang community. In February 2009, Ulf began his new job as CTO of Erlang Solutions Ltd.
